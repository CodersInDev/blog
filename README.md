#Why

We are Coders in Dev and we want to show you our work. We are learning web development at [Founders and Coders](http://http://foundersandcoders.org/), a cooperative that provides an education in coding for free, and also completes freelance web projects.


#What

This is our website where you can follow our progress over the 8 weeks of our course. Each week will centre around a different project, and we will post them all here. We also aim to maintain a blog describing our progress.


#How

You can find a live version at http://codersindev.github.io/blog/
We use harp to host our application and you can do the same:

$ npm install -g harp
$ cd Desktop
$ git clone https://github.com/foundersandcoders/oursite.git
$ cd oursite
$ harp server


#User Stories
